# Exploring LLMs in Storytelling and Q\&A Generation for Education Using Alpha-Mini Robot

This is the Masters semester project of Yasmine Chaker, conducted in the CHILI lab and supervised by Daniel Carnieto Tozadore.

## Project description
In this project, we integrate a fine-tuned version of Phi-3-mini model to an interactive interface compatible with UBTECH’s Alpha-Mini Humanoid Robot. We conduct experiments in a classroom of an International School with three groups of year-4 students. The goal is to evaluate and compare the stories and questions & answers generated by three models: our fine-tuned model, OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-turbo and teacher-generated content.

## Folders
* `Generated_stories_Q&A` : contains the stories and Q&As used in the sessions for the three groups.
* `feedback_analysis` : contains the notebooks of preprocessing and analysis of the results + digitized data.
* `llms_generation_scripts` : contains two Google Colaboratory notebooks used to generate the stories and Q&As by the LMMs.
* `Teachers_file` : written by the teachers, details the objectives of each lesson for each day.


## Environment
Create a conda environment with python version 3.11.5 and the requirements specified in `feedback_analysis/requirements.txt`.

For 'api_generation_code.ipynb`to work, you need to specify your API key.
